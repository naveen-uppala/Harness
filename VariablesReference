##Reference variables


For custom variables, the expression you use depends on where you created the variable and from where you are referencing the variable. For example:

Account variable reference: <+variable.account.VARIABLE_NAME>
Org variable reference: <+variable.org.VARIABLE_NAME>
Project variable reference: <+variable.VARIABLE_NAME>
Pipeline variable reference: <+pipeline.variables.VARIABLE_NAME>
Stage variable reference (within the same stage where you defined it): <+stage.variables.VARIABLE_NAME>
StepGroup variable reference (within the same step group where you defined it): <+stepGroup.variables.VARIABLE_NAME>
Service variable reference: <+serviceVariables.VARIABLE_NAME>
Environment variable reference: <+env.variables.VARIABLE_NAME>
